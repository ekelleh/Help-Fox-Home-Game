# Getting Home - A Story Game

https://helle.ke/Help-Fox-Home-Game/

This is a story-based game where your decisions will affect the outcome. You are a tiny and cunning city fox out on adventure. Based on your decisions you will either find you way home or you'll meet your faith. You have 3 attempts to get home, if you choose the wrong path you loose a life and you'll have to return to the beginning.
There are several routes home, but one is shorter than the rest.

The inspiration for this game came from my childhood in the 90's and the 'choose your own adventure' -story books I had. When I had decided to make a story game I ran into the question about what the story should be about. While thinking about this I ran into the fox that lives nearby our house and that I have rand into several times in the evening, so this game is dedicated to that fox.

I tried to construct the basic game mechanics in a simple way that allows any data input i.e. the content of the story can be changed to any story. In the end I would like to be able to make it open for the community so that anyone can input their own (fox) story.

This is my first ever game, made during the Ironhack web development bootcamp in Berlin, spring 2019.
