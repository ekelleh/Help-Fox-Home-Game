# Get Home - Story Game

This is a story-based game where your decisions will affect the outcome. You are a tiny and cunning city fox out on adventure. Based on your decisions you will either find you way home or you'll meet your faith. There are several routes home, but one is shorter than the rest.

This is my first ever game!
