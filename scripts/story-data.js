This is a big city, especially for a small (however cunning) fox like you. As the sun sets, you start padding east, where you can see the first stars. You want to get home to your cosy little fox hole where you know you have some food stored. You feel hunger grumbling at the bottom of your belly and you feel a faint smell of food coming from somewhere, you:"
